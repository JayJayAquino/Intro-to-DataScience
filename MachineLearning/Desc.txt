Types of Machine Learning covered
  Regression
    Linear Regression
    Logistic Regression

  Bayesian
    Naive Bayes(Gaussian, Bernoulli & Multinomial)

  Dimension Reduction
    Principal Component Analaysis(PCA)

  Instance Based
    k-Nearest Neighbor
    (k-NN) Algorithm

  Clustering
    K-Means Clustering
    Hierarchical Clustering
    Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
      (DBSCAN)

Common Terms
  Feature - Variables, columns, attributes, and fields
  Instance - row, observation, data point, value, and case
  Target - predictant and dependent Variables
  Data - predictor or set of predictor Variables

  Testing and Training
  Supervised and Unsupervised
    Supervised e.g. - spam detection
    Unsupervised e.g. - putting a house on the market

Factor Analysis
  Definition - A method used to explore datasets to find root
    causes that explain why data is acting a certain way

  Factors (latent variables) = Variables that are quite meaningful
    but are inferred and not directly observable

  Assumptions
    Features are metric
    Features are continuous or ordinal
    There is a r > 0.3 correlation between the features in your dataset
    You have > 100 observations and > 5 observations per feature
    Sample is homogenous

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
  Definition - A linear algebra method that decomposes a matrix into
    three resultant matrices to reduce information redundancy and noise

  Most commonly used for principal component analysis.
  Principal Components - Uncorrelated features that embody a dataset's important
    information (its "variance") with the redundancy, noise, and outliers stripped out.

    (synthetic representations of a dataset)

  PCA Use Cases
    Fraud detection
    Spam detection
    Image recognition
    Speech recognition

  When Using Factors and Components
    Both factors and components represent what is left of a dataset after
      information redundancy and noise is stripped out

    You can use them as input variables for machine learning algorithms, to
      generate predictions from these compressed representations of your data.
